# Hey there, I'm Nathan! üëã

Welcome to my GitHub! While being a student may be my "day job," I am an engineer at heart who just loves building AI tools and products. Hopefully some of these projects below will excite you about the futuristic capabilities of AI. 

### Building Practical AI Solutions

I love applying AI to solve practical challenges. Some of my projects I‚Äôm super proud of include:

1. **[Accelerating Aslyum GenAI Demo](https://border-demo-70326.web.app/)**: A demo website that showcases how Gen AI could be used in the US immagration/asylum system. This includes RAG demos, LLM summaries, custom priority metrics and many more. The website uses data from 71 simulated asylum cases that were uniquely generated with Gemini 2.0. This was the winnning project for the "Gen AI for the Common Good Challenge" hosted by UVA McIntire and was presented to professors, WillowTree, Google, and ex-OpenAI execs. Learn more about it [here](https://experience.mcintire.virginia.edu/news/generative-ai-common-good-competition-concept-competition-brings-student-innovation-to-mcintire/).

2. **[Model Context Protocol (MCP) Hosting Platform](https://mcp-platform-95301.web.app/)**: This is a website that allows users to connect to cloud-hosted MCP servers and supercharge their AI assistants with powerful tools. No local setup required - just plug and play with Claude for Desktop, Cursor AI, and other MCP clients (Note: this is still a work in progess). 

3.  **[Squirrel Spotter](https://github.com/nwang783/sq-cnn)**: A PyTorch-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can detect squirrels in images. This was a fun project that was an attempt to help my dad find a way to stop squirrels from eating the peaches in his garden. 

4. **[UVA Schedule Genie](https://github.com/nwang783/ai-advisor)**: Using a CSP algorithm, this tool automates personalized scheduling -- while taking into account prof. ratings -- for University of Virginia students. Many UVA students (myself included) have used it to build optimal schedules. Check it out at this [link](https://border-demo-70326.web.app/)!
