# Hey there, I'm Nathan! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate explorer of AI technologies, deeply committed to making AI systems not only smart but also safe. From safeguarding against prompt injections to building solutions for real-world problems, I'm all about using AI for good.

## 🌌 What I'm All About

### AI Safety Training Advocate

Safety first! I'm dedicated to promoting responsible AI practices. Whether it's training models to resist prompt injections or designing systems that prioritize ethical guidelines, AI safety is my top priority. **Check out my** **[AI Safety Training and Prompt Injection repository](#)** to dive into this important work.

### Building Practical AI Solutions

I love applying AI to solve practical challenges. Two projects I’m super proud of include:

1. **[Squirrel Spotter](https://github.com/nwang783/sq-cnn)** 🐿: A PyTorch-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can detect squirrels in images. It’s a fun project with a serious focus on developing robust computer vision models.

2. **[UVA Schedule Genie](https://github.com/nwang783/ai-advisor)** 🔬: Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and the OpenAI API, this tool automates personalized scheduling for University of Virginia students. It’s like having your own academic advisor in your pocket.

## 🔧 Skills & Tools

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, and a sprinkle of C for good measure.
- **Frameworks:** PyTorch, firebase , React.
- **AI Techniques:** Transformers, RAG, CNNs, and fine-tuning language models.
- **Platforms:** Firebase, AWS, and GitHub for seamless collaboration.
